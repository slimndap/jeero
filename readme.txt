Imports events and tickets from your existing ticketing solution to The Events Calendar and other popular calendar plugins.

== Description ==

Jeero bridges the gap between your ticketing solution and your website.

Tired of manually copying your event data from your external ticketing solution into WordPress? Jeero handles this for you, keeping your website fully updated with showtimes, prices, descriptions, images, and deep links to your online ticketing interface.

= Are you missing a ticketing solution? =
My goal is to provide imports from any ticketing system to any calendar plugin. Please contact me so that I can include your solution as well.

= Get started for free =
Slim & Dapper's Jeero is a subscription-based service. Within the plugin, you can easily set up a free subscription. The free subscription is fully functional, displaying up to ten upcoming events at any given time. When you're ready to display more events, you can upgrade to a paid plan.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins -> Add New and look for 'Jeero'.
2. Install and activate the Jeero plugin.
3. Go to Jeero in the WordPress admin and click on ‘Add Import’.
4. Select your ticketing solution and your calendar plugin and submit the form.
5. Fill in the missing fields in the form. Submit the form.

Wait a couple of minutes (max 5) and go to your Calendar plugin.

You should see the first 10 upcoming events that are coming from your ticketing solutions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upgrade? =

I am still working on the subscription engine. Once it is ready the possibility to upgrade will be made available inside the plugin. It shouldn't take long. For now you can [contact me](mailto:jeroen@slimndap.com) so I can upgrade you manually.

= How much will it cost? =

Subscription rates will range from €20 - €30 per month, depending on your total number of events.
